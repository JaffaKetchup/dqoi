**Currently in pre-release whilst I finalise the API & ensure the encoder/decoder conforms to the standard and is efficient**

A Dart implementation of the "[Quite OK Image Format](https://qoiformat.org/)", with a command line interface for console use and a library for use in applications.

Based off of [the official C implementation](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi/blob/master/qoi.h) and [LowLevelJavaScript's implementation](https://github.com/LowLevelJavaScript/QOI).

## Command Line Interface

### Setup

Very little setup is required. Simply clone this repository, and start using the 'bin/dqoi.exe' executable on Windows. Currently on Windows is supported for the CLI, but the library should work anywhere.

### Usage

You can list the available options by just running the executable with no arguments or with '--help'.

## Application Library

**Currently in development, please watch for more developments!**

## FAQ

- How do I pronounce the name of this library?
  _It's up to you, but I like "decoy" best._
- Why wasn't this ported to Dart sooner?
  _I'm not sure either. You can see all the other available ports on the [official README](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi#implementations--bindings-of-qoi).
